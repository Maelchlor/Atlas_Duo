# ATLAS DUO
A planned Discord bot. Details added over time


Branch Strategy
Main > Active bot. DO NOT EDIT THIS BRANCH
is_online = true

DEV > Test code. direct editing is acceptible, not recommended

Sub branch off of dev for specific projects, pull to dev through request then after dev testing is done pull to main to distribute


MAIN will be locked as soon as I figure out how to do so.

Later this will be open to the public, I plan on licensing this eventually as an open source or a restricted license. not sure yet. 

Basically I want to allow people to contribute, however if someone steals it and starts to sell I can make sure to stop it. 

Readme needs filled out better... this is still mostly placeholder data
